## What is the main purpose of pcHealth?

The main purpose of pcHealth is to assist 'users' that are working in the IT business to run some simple things to check the system on defaults. Besides that you can download some simple programs (that are well known) to assist you in a deeper investigation of the system. This script is purely to enlighten the work in the workfield, exspecially for repetetive things like this.

## How to use?

First of all I want to thank you, for downloading and using this script!
It really means a lot to me!

If you have any tips/tricks or remarks? 
Feel free to contact me on discord: REALSDEALS#6353

### For users that are not that known about what everything may or may not do...

#### Tools Menu:
The entries that you may enter in this menu will execute some standard line of code.
So keep in mind that the .exe (this script) needs to be in administrator mode, it will prompt you when you open the program.

You have my promise, that I won't do anything malicious to your pc.
But I can only keep that promise if you are sure to have downloaded pcHealth.bat from my repo: https://github.com/REALSDEALS/pcHealth 
Otherwise I can keep no promise to that statement.

1. Gather generic information about the system.
2. Check for which CPU and GPU are in the system.
3. Run a scan for corrupt and/or missing files. (Windows iso related)
4. When option 3. can't repair the corrupt/missing files, you can try this option. (DISM)
5. Option 3. and 4. combined. (Puts both commands behind eachother)
6. Generate a battery report. (To see how your laptop battery is doing)
7. Shortcut to Windows Update.
8. Short ping test. (Do I have internet?)
9. Continues ping test. (Does my internet stop at certain times?)
10. Re-open the battery report. (Can't find my generated report anymore? Try opening it this way)

#### Programs menu:
The entries that you may put in here will redirect you to the download page of the program.
Most of them are 'direct links.'

I understand if people have their questions about that decision, but I wanted to make it as easy as possible for the you as a user.

## Win_Scan

Yes, Win_Scan is my other repository, but the function that Win_Scan does has been implemented here...
So you can use both, I'll keep both of them up, but this one will be more advanced when it's finished.
